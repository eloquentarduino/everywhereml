# EverywhereML

A Python package to train Machine Learning models that run (almost) everywhere, including:

- [X] C++ / embedded systems
- [X] Javascript
- [X] PHP
- [ ] Go / TinyGo
- [ ] MicroPython
- [ ]  ... other languages
 
This means you can deploy your models to:

 - Edge devices
 - Web servers
 - Web browsers
 - ... other environments
 
 
## Components

The package implements most of the tools you need to develop a fully functional model, including:

- [X] Data loading and visualization
- [X] Preprocessing
  - [ ] Pipeline
  - [X] BoxCox (power transform)
  - [X] CrossDiff
  - [X] MinMaxScaler
  - [X] Normalizer
  - [X] PolynomialFeatures
  - [X] RateLimit
  - [X] StandardScaler
  - [X] YeoJohnson (power transform)
- [ ] Audio
  - [ ] MelSpectrogram
- [X] Feature selection
  - [X] RFE
  - [X] SelectKBest
- [ ] Time series analysis
  - [X] Diff
  - [X] Fourier transform
  - [X] Rolling window
  - [ ]  TSFRESH 
- [ ] Classification
  - [X] RandomForest
  - [X] LogisticRegression
  - [X] GaussianNB
  - [ ]  BernoulliNB
  - [ ] SVM (not tested)
  - [ ]  LinearSVM
  - [X] DecisionTree
  - [X] XGBoost
  - [ ]  Catboost
 - [ ]  Regression
  - [ ] LinearRegression
    
    
Each of these components can be trained in Python and exported to any of the supported languages
with no (or as few as possible) external dependencies.

For example:

```
from everywhereml.data.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

transformer = MinMaxScaler()
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
Xt, yt = transformer.fit_transform(X, y)

print('Original range', (X.min(), X.max()))
print('Transformed range', (Xt.min(), Xt.max()))

# port to C++
print(transformer.port(language='cpp'))

# port to Js
print(transformer.port(language='js'))

# port to PHP
print(transformer.port(language='php'))
```
